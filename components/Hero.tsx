                I am a student majoring in Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.
                I enjoy creating things for the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
                I also enjoy configuring servers such as the server that is hosting this site!.
                I have experience working in frontend with React, Next and Tailwind CSS.
                And in backend development with Express, Flask and SocketIO.
                I also do other programming other than web development such as Python.
